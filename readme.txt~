   A low-level game engine for DOS

------------------------------------
	  1. INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------

Placeholder text for now. Basically,
this is gonna be the game engine I
use for DOS game development. I
tried using Allegro and it ended up
pissing me off (as do most third-
party libraries) so I decided to
make my own. It is coded in ANSI
C89-compliant pure C, with 0
dependencies. It aims to provide
a set of library functions that
will handle screen drawing, kb/m
i/o, and sound effects. I plan on
starting simple and then expanding
on it further. I have no doubt that
I will fall victim to scope creep and
that this project will spire the fuck
out of control into an unsalvagable
mess, but until then, I hope to at
the very least code an engine that
gives 60 FPS gameplay, with libs for
both 2D and 3D graphics, as well as
the other typical low-level funcs
expected for game dev. Once the
libraries are all fleshed out, I
plan on making gamedev tools for
CCOMET like a graphics editor, 3d
modeling software, music/sound
designers, all native to DOS because
its so fun developing on old
hardware!
